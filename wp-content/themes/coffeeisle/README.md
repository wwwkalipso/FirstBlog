##Description
CoffeeIsle is a classy WordPress theme for online shops and blogging. It has a beautiful, unique interface providing a full-width parallax header, oblique post shapes, and a slide-out menu. The store section follows the same design lines, each product being displayed in a nice oblique form. The theme was built with e-commerce (WooCommerce) in mind, that's why it comes with an alternative shop page which you can use on your site in case you like it better than the default template. As for the features, CoffeeIsle is responsive, WPML ready, SEO friendly, and easy to customize. It also has social icons, custom fonts, video post format, and multiple color schemes: you can use 3 different colors at the same time to create beautiful contrasts - background, post/product boxes, and the oblique line under each entry in the shop and blog pages.
